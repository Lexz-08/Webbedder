## Description
A program that displays any specified webpage using CefSharp, with some URL restrictions (HTTP, HTTPS, and DATA only).<br><br>
*Supports multiple instances because each instance runs separately, although, there is no `TOP-MOST` feature, so you will have to keep the/each window in an easily accessible area to continually use it.*

## Command-Line
Usage to Auto-Embed: `<path_to>\Webbedder.exe "<your_link>" /y`<br>
Usage to Just Open: `<path_to>\Webbedder.exe "<your_link>"`
